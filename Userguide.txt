Quick Startup Guide (MySQL + Schema/TestData + Tomcat + App)
1. Prepare MySQL and load schema + test data
Open a terminal.
Log in to MySQL:
mysql -u root -p
(Enter your MySQL root password.)
Create and/or select your database (only needed once):
CREATE DATABASE automotive_db;
USE automotive_db;
In a normal terminal (not inside the MySQL shell), run your schema file:
mysql -u root -p automotive_db < schema.sql
Then run your test data file:
mysql -u root -p automotive_db < testdata.sql
(Optional) Check if tables and data are there (inside MySQL):
USE automotive_db;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM car LIMIT 5;
2. Build the Java web application with Maven
Go to the project root folder (where pom.xml is located):
cd /path/to/your/project
Build the project:
mvn clean package
After a successful build, Maven will create a WAR file in:
target/your-artifact-name.war
(The actual name depends on the artifactId in your pom.xml.)
3. Configure and run Tomcat in IntelliJ
In IntelliJ, open:
Run → Edit Configurations...
Click the “+” button, choose:
Tomcat Server → Local
In the Deployment tab:
Click “+” → Artifact
Select your WAR artifact (the one Maven created).
Set the Application context to:
/
(So the app is available directly at http://localhost:8080/.)
Apply and close the dialog.
If you ever get a permission error on catalina.sh, run:
chmod +x /path/to/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh
4. Start Tomcat and open the application
In IntelliJ, click the green Run button for the Tomcat configuration.
Wait until the console shows that Tomcat started successfully (no errors).
Open a browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080/
(Or http://localhost:8080/your-context if you used another context path.)
You should now see your new index.html Toyota HK frontend.

5. If the page still shows the “old” version
Check that your HTML file is here:
src/main/webapp/index.html
Make sure the file content is the new version you want.
Rebuild and redeploy:
mvn clean package
In IntelliJ:
Stop Tomcat.
Start Tomcat again.
In the browser, do a hard reload:
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + F5
